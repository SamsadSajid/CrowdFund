# CrowdFund

**CrowdFund** is a web application which is built using Ethereum. 
**Ethereum** is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart 
contract functionality. It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions.

The backend of this application is built using **Solidity** programming laguage and the front end is built using **Ract js**. 

**Solidity** is used to write the contracts of the Campaigns.

Here people can create a **campaign**.People can donate to this campaign. When some amount is needed to transact to build some 
sub-system of the project, the manager, who has created the campaign can issue a request. After that, people who has donated to
the campaign has to approve the request. To finalize a request a manager is needed at least one more than half of the approvals
of the persons who have donated, also known as approvers.

After that, a manager can finalize a request.
